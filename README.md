# Frontend Development Study Project
## Overview
This repository contains my study materials and exercises as I delve into Frontend Development. The focus is on understanding the fundamental concepts of JavaScript, with practical tasks designed to reinforce these concepts.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to build a solid foundation in JavaScript, which is essential for any aspiring Frontend Developer. Through a series of exercises and problems, I aim to understand and apply core programming principles.

## Topics Covered
* Data Types and Variable Declarations: Understanding primitive and reference data types, and how to declare variables using var, let, and const.
* Scope: Differentiating between global and local scope, and understanding the scope chain.
* Loops: Using for, while, and do...while loops to iterate over data.
* Array Methods: Exploring methods like map, filter, reduce, forEach, and others to manipulate arrays.
* String Methods: Using methods to manipulate and search within strings.
* Object Methods: Understanding objects and utilizing methods to interact with object properties.
* Closures: Grasping the concept of closures and their applications in JavaScript.
* Hoisting: Learning about hoisting and its implications on variable and function declarations.
* Currying: Implementing and understanding the currying technique in JavaScript functions.
## Exercises
To apply the concepts learned, a series of coding exercises and challenges were undertaken, including but not limited to:

* Fibonacci Sequence: Writing a function to find a number at a specific position in the Fibonacci sequence.
* Pascal's Triangle: Generating Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.
* Sudoku Solver: Implementing an algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.
